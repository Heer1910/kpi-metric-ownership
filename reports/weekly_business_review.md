### Key Risks to Monitor

1. **Retention Plateau Risk:** As Orders/Customer reaches 16+, growth may slow - prepare new retention tactics
2. **Merchandising Underperformance:** Items/Order contributing only 3% of growth - opportunity not captured
3. **Data Quality:** Ensure base tables refresh on schedule as customer base grows
4. **Seasonal Effects:** Monitor for day-of-week and time-of-day pattern changes
5. **Power User Concentration:** 80% of orders from 48% of customers - diversification needed
